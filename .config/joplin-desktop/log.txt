2024-09-17 12:22:14: shouldPasteResources: Pasted text: As he stands over me, I feel the rope taught against their wrists and thighs. I could not pull away if I wanted to....but I know I never would.

The air in the dungeon was warmer than I thought it would be, with the cages, bars and racks everywhere. But it was comfortable enough to be naked. Tied and exposed like this always sent a chill through my body. He had promised me I would melt tonight, that everything in the world would fade away. But I just could not shake this chill in my body, tied up like this....is he going to get the whip? His favourite flogger? Please not the cane tonight...

I know it makes my mind go blank with every spark it send through my body, but I don't know how much I could handle tonight. I would try for him though..

I was so nervous as he moved around the room. He took such care to make sure I was comfortable while he restraind me tonight. The control and love he put into it. the closeness as his body brushed against mine.

The chill went down my spine and I could not help but quiver ever so slightly.

He smirked when he saw it. Then he reached down to his briefcase and pulled something out. It was darker in the room and I couldn't quite tell.... It was his warmer! He was preparing his hands....preparing for every touch to be warm on my skin. To hold and caress my body....This man had more control over my body than I ever thought another could possess. Knowing his warm touch was coming....the chill in my body was gone and

all I needed was for his hands to be on my body.




I knew what was coming....like the moment just before the kiss. He was preparing himself. Knowing his touch would be so strong and warm, knowing it was coming but when. The anticipation grew with every moment he held the warming stone. Finally he sets it down. His back to me and I know what's coming. I have never needed to feel someone's touch more than I did in that moment.

As he turns and comes toward me I know I'm not breathing. I can't remember when I last breathed. Just screaming in my head for him to grab me, move me, use me, FUCKING HANDLE ME! How can I think so many things before he has even moved toward me. Reaching down he grabs the ropes that go over my shoulder. God his hands have me. The harness he grabs, holds my entire upper body and he has me completely in his control now.

My body shifts up to where he pulls me in close. pulling me in closer, his lips coming near mine and I can contain it.. I reach up and press my mouth to his with a hunger I didn't know I possessed. I was greedy for this, and he knew it. I was in his control and still I needed to ascert my needs here. I knew what would happen the moment

I reached out. And I wanted it. Then the squeeze came. I took what I wanted and his free hand closed around my throat and I felt the warm strength as he gripped me. Not pushing me away, letting me

have my desire but reminding me who had the power in that moment.

I could have lived in that moment for hours, but then he lowered me back to my sitting position. His fun with me was just about to begin. That evil smile on his face...

he knew I needed this and he was going to make me ache for every moment of he gave me.



My legs were tied like I was kneeling, but they weren't tied together. I could spread them or try and keep them closed if I struggled hard enough, but I couldn't stand up or kick away if I needed to. My arms behind my back, tied together and the harness tied across my chest. With his grip on the rope over my shoulder he had complete control over the movement of my body. He lowered me down after the kiss, pulling away only inches though. his hand still on my throat, he lets go of his hold on my harness and started to slide his hand down my body.

moving across the ropes, brushing along my breast, his finger teasing with a little rub on my nipple as his hand passed by and my whole body shivered. His hands were so warm, but everywhere he touched me was like lightning through my body. Moving down across my stomach, tracing the lines of the muscle I worked so hard on....moving away from where I want him to go his fingers glide along my hip brushing down to where my thigh is bent and held in place. A tight squeeze by his hand on my thigh and he forces my legs further apart as he looks in my owns like he owns me right then and there was not a thing I could do to stop this.

His fingers moving to the inside of my thigh, tracing along the ropes keeping me kneeling for him. Every time my skin feels the slightest brush of his finger tip it send a shock up my leg and hits my clit like lightning.

He inches his hand further up my leg and I can't hide the whimper in my voice. His hand never leaving my throat.

"Such a needy little slut aren't you?" He growls at me. I'm a complete mess right now. Tied up, I can't possibly move and I'm drooling from my mouth and between my thighs. I'm basically an animal. i can't think.

I can't speak. I'm only able to make sounds like the feral little slut I am. He knows it too. He knows I've need this for a long time now. I've had my fun and I've gone on my dates. But he knows I need to come back to him to feel this way right here. To feel like I've been handled, like my energy isn't contained

but let loose to burn by someone who can handle me when I lose control.



He moves his hands along the inside of my thigh. He always likes to tease me here. He never gives me what I need so quickly. Tongiht was different. Tonight he knew what I needed. Moving between my thighs he brushes his fingers along my lips. Tracing my vulva, teasing the edges of my pussy. He was coming for me tonight. Melting my mind.

Moving his finger tip from the bottom to the top and he pauses for the briefest of moments and I know my whole body just stops. Heart, breathe, thought. Nothing in me moves.

Then he moves his hand. The warmth he built up and there is the pressure I needed to feel. He presses down with the palm of his hand on my clit. Teasing along my lips with his finger...and I let out a sound I have never made before. A grunt. A groan. Something from the animal inside me. Grinding his hand into me. Driving me wild.

His hand on my throat and his other grinding his palm into my clit as my hips move to increase the pressure.

"Good little whore loves the pressure doesn't she?" as he presses up with his palm lifting my whole body up. And my eyes roll back in my head.



His fingers slide inside me and I can only make the noises I do when there's nothing human left in me.

He lets go of my throat and part of me misses it immediately. Being in his control that way. My whole upper body shifts back and I feel like I might lose control of myself and his free hand moves down to my hip. Gripping me there at the bend between thigh and waist. Squeezing as he presses his body in close to me and his fingers inside me curl and tease....and then he brushes up against that spot and my body lurches forward as I groan. I need that pressure. I need to feel him gripping me. Everywhere.

He slides his fingers out and pulls his strong hand away from me. Looking up at him with those whimpering eyes. My mouth barely open and his hand comes up to slide his fingers in my mouth and I greedily start to suck. The way I taste drives me wild in these moments. Knowing these fingers were just in me. Just making me feel this way.

As he slides his fingers from my mouth, he cups the side of my cheek. One hand on my hip, the other holding me gently. He leans in and gives me the most gentle of kisses. "You're right. you taste incredible." He smirks at here. Then she sees the flash of fire in his eyes and he pulls his hand back and brings it back down to slap her across the face. He's hit her harder before, but she knows he wants to play with the animal in her. From pleasure to fire. The instant of shock when he hits her and she reacts just the way she should and lurches her mouth forward to try and bite down on him. Anywhere on him she can get to. And she makes it too. Gets deep into his shoulder as she hears his breathe sharpingly suck in and he grunts in pain and pleasure at her reaction.



Growling, his hand flies back to her throat and forces her whole body back on the bed in the dungeon. Her shoulders against the sheets, her tied legs can't help but fall open to him as she fell back. She knew if she tried she could keep her legs closed she could. He hadn't tied them that way on purpose. But she knew exactly what she needed.

She knew she wanted his animal when she bit into him. Leaving herself open and exposed to him daring him to devour her.

Pinned to the bed with his hand around her throat. More pressure than he had ever used before. There was that one moment of fear in the back of her mind, had she finally pushed him to far? Did she bite down too hard? But those thoughts lasted only the briefest of moments because she knew it. She knew when she got this way, she was the whore looking for more.

There she was, his hand pressing down on her throat, her legs spread wide exposing herself to him. She could feel him towering over her. Could feel him pressed against the back of her thighs. He could mount her as the feral slut she was right then and nothing would have made her happier. Her bound hands behind her back, just low enough that they helped to raise her hips up. Positioning her perfectly for him to see her drooling

to see her dripping wet and needing more from him.

His free hand reaching down between her thighs, grabbing at her ass and squeezing. Owning her in that moment. not because she gave herself to him, but the way you own something that could not escape from you if it tried. Her body was his to play with and enjoy, and all she could do was take every moment of it.

leaving bruised marks from his finger tips after gripping her so hard. She had lit that fire when she bit him. She knew this would not be a gentle night. She was so wet already, she knew it didn't matter and she wanted it.

He reached over to where they kept the lube pump and made sure his fingers were well covered.

Sliding his fingers along her dripping went pussy, without warning, he pushed 2 of his fingers inside her and she groaned at how easily he slid inside and how it felt when he stretched her. She had already given up all hopes of controlling herself tonight, and in the back of her head she heard herself mutter "Break me!"

Grinding his palm on to her clit, curling his fingers, beckoning her inside to come to him. Teasing her, rubbing her, he began to move his entire wrist, his entire hand. Not only his fingers teasing her

to come to him inside, but moving with rhythm, every twist of his wrist would stretch her just as his finger tip would complete the curl.




The other people at the dungeon party stood mesmerized by the display being put on. It was only minutes into the show and everyone there could immediately tell the two performers were acting as the only people in the room. They were completely lost in the moment, the feel and aura of each other. The feral slut and controlling man were

ever in their element. You could even see their intensity begin to spread as another couple walked to a nearby bench to begin their own dark fun.





His hand grinding and thrusting inside her. Her hips lifting higher than they already lay to meet each thrust of his hand. The way he is stretching her, fucking her and pressing down on her clit driving her wild. She felt like she was finally being used the way she needed to be. Pulling his hand from her throat, the blood starts rushing back to her head, the light headed feeling pushing the sensations coursing through her body to new extremes.

The ropes pulling at her skin, his hand fucking her like the slut she is. Sliding his hand down from her throat he starts to grope at her breasts, teasing and pinching her nipples. Exploring her gyrating body.

He leans forward, pressing his weight down onto her, his hand working rhythmically, but more and more aggressively. Stretching and teasing and grinding into her. She was losing all control and had become a constant stream of moans and grunts like the animal she was. He had never used her quite like this before. She felt like she

really might break this time. And fuck did she love this. She needed to be used like this.

Between her eyes rolling back and the flashes across her sight she could see shapes...shadows around them...

was it the club they were in? Where were they....thoughts that seemed so distant and so unimportant. Only the sensations and feeling of the moment she was in...

Her breathing started to become very shallow. The electricity coursing through her body becoming more focused. His thigh grinding his hand into her clit even harder as the pressure grew on her greedy clit. Her hips pressing up into him with more and more urgency.

Her rapid breathes, his fingers moving inside her. His free hand groping her body...... and then whole world stopped..... Her back arched and strained. Her mouth spread open where you expect to hear a moan...... and the silent scream...eyes shot wide then rolling back in her head.

Then the exhale as her whole body shook back down and the wave washed over her and finally the moan escaped her. Like a caged animal freed.

She was quivering uncontrollably now. His fingers still calling her towards him. His free hand riding along with the shaking of her body.

Everyone in the room knew that her night had only begun. When these two put on a show, it was always a special treat.







As she started to regain her breathing, his fingers slowed their pace and slid from inside her. The pressure on her clit relaxed.

His body weight still pressed into her, he leaned in close. He knew her mind was still a mess of excitement and fear and lust. He knew she was more feral than ever

still. But he wanted to communicate with her.

"Good Slut"

"That's how we put on a show for everyone."

Still lost in her lust. What was he saying. What did he mean?

"I'm not near done with you tonight. I'm going to break you down in the ways that make my evil side smile."

"I'm going to make you sore for days."

"Then, when I think you're sore enough, I'm going to take you and mount my feral little bitch infront of everyone."

He smiled that evil smile as he leaned back. His pant leg covered in the evidence of her losing control. She had painted him in her moments of ecstacy.

He enjoyed when he took her that far.

---------------------------------------


As he stands with that evil smile, a fun game occurs to him.

"Deviants and Demons, Ladies and Gentlemen. Tonight I want to take this slut on a journey. Let's get right to the fun part. I have here some lovely toys and tools. What does the crowd want to see her enjoy?"

As he lifted a rather...thick looking dildo some in the crowd gasped. Some giggled and a couple people were nodding their heads. "I see the smiles out there, but not this one...yet. She has some stretching to do first."

Next he pulls out the cane. "Does this feral kitty need stripes across her ass?" ...."No, not tonight. I don't mean to be curel...tonight. But more pleasure than that."

"I know what she needs....everyone knows her favourite saying. Ditch him and get a Doxy." as he pulled the deep, ruby red Doxy from his briefcase. Smiles and agreement all around. "She's had plenty of time to breathe and come back to us. Let's see how far we can push her this time."





As he walks over to her, he sets down the new toy selection on a side table. Reaching down he grabs ahold of the rope harness she is wearing, pulling her close to him. So many other people would still be weak and barely back together. This one, she has fire in her eyes after only a moment to breathe.

Knowing that the crowd around them is watching her, seeing just how insatiable she is. As he pulls her in close, she nips at him trying for another bite. Moving his shoulder out of the way this time, then reaching with his free hand to grab a handful of her hair and pull her head back.

"MY TURN, slut" He growls as he leans in biting down on her neck. Making sure to leave his mark upon her.

Letting go of her hair, he reaches down to loosen the ropes around her torso. Slowly unbinding her.

You could see the smile on her face. She was going to have her arms free to claw and grope.

The mischief was flashing across her face. Even with her legs still bound, she was almost too excited to have her hands free. And then she heard the metalic clink.

He reached behind his back and pulled out the steel chains. The wrist straps already attached and he grabbed her hand as quickly as he could. Buckling the strap around her wrist and reaching back to close the link on the steel loops at the edge of the bed.

Only a moment later, her other wrist strapped and chained down too.

She had more movement than she did when seh was tied up by the ropes, but still could only move her arms a short distance before the chain reminded her of her predicament.

Standing, walking behind her as he gazed at her, inspected this woman chained and tied. The sheen of sweat on her body from their first little game. The fire, lust and NEED for more in her eyes after the first wave of orgasms rolled through her.

He kneeled down behind her. Wrapping his left arm around her waist, pulling her in close. Her body pressed against his. With the chains on her wrists, she could just reach back enough to grip and claw at his thighs. "This fucker is stil wearing clothes she thought to herself." as she tried to leave marks on him more than her what she left with her teeth before.

His arm holding her close, pressing her against him. His other free hand started to explore her body. Starting down on her still bound thighs. Tracing his fingers along the ropes, coming to the place on her skin that met the rope. Tracing up her thigh, her hip and across to her navel. Up her stomach and he starts to trace along the marks left from the rope once there. The signs of her bondage before that she strained against in their first game.

All along her body he traces, her head falling back to rest against him as she enjoyed the feeling of his hands and his eyes exploring and inspecting her body held close to him. As she felt so deeply desired and needed his hands slid up her body, past her breasts brushing against her nipples. Then again....oh fuck it was beginning....his hand was back to her throat. His place to hold her, to remind her she was playing in his games.

His free hand reaching over and grabbing his wand.







She didn't hear the button click, but she heard the low rumble the second it came to life. And she held her breathe knowing what was coming.

Bringing the wand around, infront of her as it rumbled away.

He lowered it down, teasing where he would touch her with it. Then he brushed it against her thigh. The vibration like the spark to hit kindling and her body was alive!

He slowly slide the wand up and down her thigh as the vibraiton would get furhte rup her thigh she felt it getting close...

Then it was off of her skin. And she whimpered at the loss of sensation.

But not for long past her crotch, the vibrations found there way to her aerolas. To tease around her nipples. To spark the fire around her heart. She pressed herself back into him. Wanting the vbrations everywhere and to feel him against her.

Pulling the wand away from her breasts he cupped the head of the vibrator and lowred his arm down her torso.

"I'm not one for patience....and I want to hear that moan of yours."

As he slide the head of the vibrator directly to her clit and cupping the head, he slide his fingers back inside her, still dripping wet. And her eyes closed. She knew how he liked to play with the vibes and that this would not end with only the first wave of orgasms to wash over her.

She had been already running on high after the first game got her started and she could already feel it flooding across her body. This man was unlocking something in her she never knew would fully be reached by another's hands.

She was losing herself in the sensations and the world around her was fading.









Her body was pressed against him now. From resting between his legs, to pressed into him with that needed urgency the second he held the vibe to her clit.

That moment of held breathe and every muscle in her body tensing when the vibe comes in contact with her fuels his lust for control over her body in these moments. Every breathe, moan, quiver. All at his whim and evil thoughts.

"Exactly where I want you slut!" he whispers in her ear nibbling on her lobe.

Biting just a bit harder and she whimpers pulling away.

He loves devouring her. Whether she's tied up and it's with his eyes or when he leaves his marks on her with his teeth and tastes every inch of her with his tongue.

He can feel as her first spasm shoots through her body and her hips quickly press back into him. That first wave when her body tries to pull back.

So he pushes the head of the vibe against her to ensure she can't escape to ongoing vibrations. His fingers curled around the head of the vibe inside her dripping wet pussy. teasing and curling inside her, beckoning her body into the vibrations as he rubs against her g-spot.

Her breathe coming in laboured gasps with the smallest of whimpers and moans while he holds her tight against him, refusing to allow her to pull away from everything she was feeling.

His one hand holding the vibe in place grinding against her clit, those fingers inside her, teasing her to climax.

Her hands shoot forward and the chains clink as she claws for his thighs and her whole body tenses and everyone watching her collectively hold their own breathe as her back arches pushing herself into his chest. That moment of complete silence in the room and then she breaks.

The guttural moan as it washes over her. Shoulders strained and strong as she pulls against the chains. Her hips spasming and he works hard to keep the vibe on her, himself straining to hold onto the feral slut writhing against him. Her legs squeezing shut, still tied in a kneeling position. Her hips pulling away from the vibrations and her own legs refusing to let them stop as she quivers and the begins to return from another plane.

But the vibrations have not stopped. His fingers will not stop working inside her, reminding her that what he wants is for her to drown in her own ecstacy tonight for the crowd.

When they put on a show for everyone, they must remember them.

His free hand now caressing her. Sliding his fingers along her thigh, up her hips and across her stomach. Cupping her breast he gropes and squeezes her.

The second wave is coming and her breathing quickly becomes shallow again. This one will be intense as someone yells out in the crowd. "CUM FOR US ALL YOU SLUT!"

and his hand reaches up to her throat as she is barely concious of what is happening around her and he whispers in her ear. "Sluts wear the prettiest of hand necklaces" Sounding like a distant memory, something from a ghost...as he wraps his hand around her neck.

Gripping her tightly, her shallow breathes restricted and the deep whimpers as it starts to flood over her....and she was gone again. Under the wave of ecstacy and fire running through her body. Fireworks and electricity flashing across her eyes.

I can't believe how stupid some people can be.

"FUCK" Jason muttered strongly to himself as he was storming out of the office.

Normally he kept his cool, but something about today just hit a raw nerve with him.

He could not remember the last time he was this angry leaving work.

Driving way too fast, playing his music in the car louder than usual. Not even in a mood to sing along today. He needed to drown out the heat and animalistic nature building inside him. The gym. The pile of wood in the yard that needed to be chopped for the bonfire. One of those would work to help calm him down.

The more he tried to distract himself, the more heated he got.

Pulling into the driveway at home, slamming the door to his car. He paused for a moment. Everything about this was abnormal for him. He never let his day get to him like this.

He growled to himself. "Grow up man."

As he came towards the door, something that felt impossible to him only moments earlier, he began to feel himself cooling off.

Opening the door, the keys jingling as he pulled them from the lock, turning around and..dropping his keys where he stood.

Dawn was bent over grabbing something that didn't matter from a lower shelf, wearing her lazy comfy pants. She wore them because they were comfy and she could lounge around the house. Jason loved themFeral Oral:

Opening the door, the keys jingling as he pulled them from the lock, turning around and..dropping his keys where he stood.

Dawn was bent over grabbing something that didn't matter from a lower shelf, wearing her lazy comfy pants. She wore them because they were comfy and she could lounge around the house. Jason loved them for the way they hugged her ass and hung low on her hips though. Adding to the way she could so easily personify being soft, fuzzy, warm...he had heard of cuteness aggression before...something so cute, it made you angry. But until this moment, it never hit home to him. Seeing her curves in those comfy clothes, he had never in his life needed to, ached to fuck her harder than he had before.

That view...her tight, round ass. The curve of her thighs wrapped in flannel....

You wouldn't think this scene would trigger him this way; but he had been so worked up, so heated only moments before and the sight of her, happily being lazy around the house drove him wild. Fire igniting in his eyes.

Not knowing what was coming she looked over her shoulder "J....we're watching Lilo &...." she paused mid sentence as she saw the look in his eyes.

Slamming the door he moved towards her. Not running, but every step he took had a heated purpose to it. He saw his prey and nothing would stop him. Her eyes going wide seeing him pounce on her like this.

Getting right up close to her as she stood up, his hand moved up, gripping her throat and pinning her to the wall. Leaning in close to her ear and growled "You know you can stop me with only a word."

The times he got like this though...it drove her wild how much of an animal he could become...if only he would do this more often...with his fist around her throat, pressed against the wall she couldn't help herself from challenging him "Try and break me"...

His eyes went wide and darkened with a wild nature. Pressing her against the wall with the weight of his entire body, he could feel his cock filling with blood.

There was no chance she could not feel his bulge growing against her thigh..

Moving his hand from her throat up to her hair, grabbing the ponytail she had it done up in, he forced her to her knees "Make your mouth useful and stop talking back to me!" he growled as his other hand went to reach for his belt.

What he didn't expect in that moment, was how quickly her own hands had started to scramble for his belt before he even could. She loved it when he forced her to her knees for him. He was always the most gentle person with her, always felt so safe with him, but these moments he let himself get this way were so far between, and she needed this from him more often.

Quickly with her fingers, undoing his belt. Pulling open the button to his pants and zipping down his fly she pulled hard on his pants. A hunger taking over herself from how much of an animal he was being.

Pulling dcown his pants so quickly had pulled his underwear low, but they were caught by the bulge, only teasing at what they held back from her.

His bulge was there infront of her. Not hard yet, but growing, she knew with only the slightest of touches from her he would be rock hard for her.

Pushing herself forward, feeling a hunger take over...

and Jason growls pulling her hair, pulling her head and mouth back from what she wanted to taste, ached to taste.

He loved how eager she was, but he was the one burngin to feel her tongue, needing to put his anger into someone.

"Such a greedy little slut. Can't wait to get your mouth on my cock, can you?"

Her head held back by the handful of hair in his fist, she snapped with her teeth in the air in the direction of engorged dick.

*SMACK* as he slapped her for the threat to his groin. Only enough to sting. He knew she didn't like it when he fully hit her, but the light slap, only enough to make her cheek sting made her immediately flush all over. He wanted her mouth, and she would let his animal desires take over.

Reaching down with his other hand, pulling his cock free from the confines of his underwear, holding it out to her mouth now. She tried again to push forward to get him in between her lips, but his grip on her head only brought her close enough to let her tongue dart out, just enough to get the tip of her tongue to taste the little bead of precum on the tip of his round, pronounced head. The ridges along the base of the head of his cock were always so much fun for her to trace with her tongue when she got to suck him. Jason always had the best hygiene, she loved being able to have him in her mouth and enjoy the way he tasted. God she wished she could do this more often. And only inches away he was holding her back, a lick was all she got.

She whimpered, needing to taste more.

"Greedy little slut." He said looking down at her. She whimpered again.

Tightening his grip on her hair.. "Mine." He growled.

Bringing her forward her mouth opening and he pressed past her lips. The head of his cock sliding along her tongue as she greedily started sucking his length into her waiting mouth.

He could feel her tongue begin to work as he moaned out loud immediately at how she needed this, almost as much as he did.

Her eyes looking up at him. She loved it when he was soft, getting to feel his blood pump, feel him grow hard in her mouth. Feel the way her mouth drove him crazy with pleasure. How it was her that made him hard like this.

He could feel her tongue sliding back and forth along the underside of his growing cock. Pushing herself to take him, taste him. His grip not loosening, but the pressure on her head was lighter. He would let her enjoy this part, the feeling of him hardening for her.

It only took a few moments, he could feel himself growing, his blood pumping. Her tongue and eagerness made him rock hard in only moments.

As soon as he could see the veins begin to bulge on the shaft of his dick, he heard her moan onto him. It always made her lose control when he became fully hard and her mouth was full of him, his taste, his smell.

At that moan though, she knew what it would do to him, and she let his strong hand, holding her hair take control of her again.

Moving his hips, he pulled back so that all of him had left her mouth, she only had a moment to lick her lips as he pushed back into her waiting mouth again. He was only on the edge of control and pushed back in harder than she expected, hearing her gag briefly. He wasn't slowing down though. He knew what she could take, he knew also that they had their safe signals. All she needed to do was double tapp him with her hand and he would stop, no matter how over the edge with lust he was.

Seeing Dawn's eyes watering from pressing too deeply though only worked to feed the animal inside him. Pulling back, and just before the head of his cock was out of her mouth, pushing back in again, this time pressing his hips forward, and pulling her in with his hand gripping her hair. He was in control here she knew it, he wanted her to choke on him and she loved feeling it. Her own gagging not phasing her, only hearing him over and over again in her mind .."Mine."

She had challenged him, and if he needed it she would let him break her. She loved when he lost control with her.

As she regained herself, her eyes watering he could feel her tongue start to work along the veins of his dick again. Eyes watering, but that eagerness to take him all. To tease and taste him no matter how challenging it got for her. Anyone else watching would say she looked like she was his toy but he could feel her enjoying herself, tasting every inch of him, tracing the veins and curves on his rock, hard cock. Her, rock hard cock. He knew she was thinking that.

Letting his grip loosen on her hair ever so slightly and Dawn got the hint. Devour him. Show him the hungry cumslut she had inside her.

She began to move her head back and forth, moving her tongue up and down his length. Pulling back so that she could enjoy tracing the edges of his cock. She could taste him, could taste the precum dripping freely from him now. Pausing with just the head of his cock in her mouth, wrapping her lips around him and sucking, pulling to get all of his delicious juices for herself.

Looking up at him she smiled, the head of his cock in her mouth and then she bit, just below the edge of the head. Not hard, but enough that he sucked his breathe in deeply. Grinning, with a cock in her mouth at the sound he made.

She knew exactly what would happen then. His hand, always holding her hair, he gripped tightly again and started to push himself back and forth. She was under his control again.

The pace he started to fuck her mouth, she could feel him starting to lose control, every time he pulled back she would run her tongue along his cock, every time he pushed in she would suck, trying to swallow all of him.

Growling his pace picked up. Here at the peak, growing in pace and aching need, he would sometimes cause her to cough and choke, but she knew he needed her, her lips, her mouth, her throat. She closed her eyes and let him use her. She was his toy and fucking loved it in those moments.

He growled and moaned deeply in his chest and she felt his hips buck, felt his cock twitch and pulse aggressivley and she felt the pleasure crash over him, felt him start to cum deep in her mouth. She could taste him and and need more, needed to taste it, swallowing everything she could.

Jasons eyes were staring at her as the pulses continued. Lust, need, fire, every emotion flashing across his eyes as he continued to pump and twitch, his legs shaking and he stumbled back, pulling his cock from her mouth right as a rope of cum shot from the head of his cock splashing across her cheek. Another pulse and a second splash of cum, this one hitting her chin, dripping down her neck.

He stumbled back now, dropping to one knee as the orgasm took his mind miles away. She saw him, on one knee in front of her now, eyes level and she looked down, saw his hard cock twicth again as a last smaller gush of cum poured out of him. Something about that made her whole body shiver. Seeing the last pulses of his orgasm push cum out of the hard cock, all because of her.

They both sat there, panting. Her eyes watery from being used. His glazed over, his pupils wide as her mouth and eagerness did everything he needed to put out the fire inside him.

His hand shaking, he reached up, brushing back her hair. No words, talking would be a couple more moments away before that could happen.

He then reached down, brushing his thumb across her cheek, wiping cum from her face. He moved his thumb towards her mouth and she greedily sucked it in. Licking his thumb clean and smiling her greedy little smile.

"mmmmmm. You must have had a day..."

Reaching his forefinger down to her chin, he scooped a glob of his cum up and took it to his own mouth, sucking his own finger clean and smirking at her.

"So...Lilo and Stitch you said..?"

(This one was fun to write. My own cock was pulsing, fully hard without a single physical touch....That was different.....)

As Kimberlee was packing up her belongings at her desk, an urge hit her. Grabbing her phone she quickly tapped out the commands.

"You've been a good boy, but today I deserve to be worshipped. You have 20 minutes until I'm home, you'll be waiting infront of the chaise.

Kneeling on your obedience pillow."

"Yes Kimberlee." The required response came from Liam. He knew his role and ached with need every time she allowed him to please her.

Absent mindedly wondering to himself just who received more pleasure from this.

As the keys kingled in her hands, she reached to open the door. Not a moments hesitation knowing what awaited her inside.

As she took off her heels, a feeling almost as good as what she knew was coming. Kicking them to the side she threw her keys in the dish by the door

and her purse on the end table.

Without any more delay she walked into the living room, where Liam awaited on his knees, head bowed.

As she walked toward the chaise, she let her hand run through his dark, chestnut brown hair. As she felt her fingers

flow through his hair, she grabbed roughly to twist his face up to her.

"Never a doubt. Good boy." As she let go of his hair, and began to pour herself into position on the chaise, getting herself comfortable.

Reaching forward, her hand sliding under his chin.

"Begin. And today, I want you to take your time. Worship me."

"Yes Kimberlee."

His hands reached down to the hem of her skirt. It drove her crazy she had to wear the longer skirts to work.

"Stupid rules." she thought to herself. "I make the rules."

One benefit though, was he could take his time raising the skirt up her thighs...Slowly pushing it up, inch by inch. Pausing to kiss her thigh.

Another inch, pausing now, his hands on her thighs and a hard, rough squeeze. He knew she loved his grip. The strength behind it. His need and ache for what was coming.

With that last squeeze of his hand, she could feel the day melting away. All that was or needed to be was this person kneeling before her. Worshipping his goddess.

Leaning forward he began kissing her thigh, just inside and above the knee.

His hands sliding the hem of her dress another inch higher. Moving across to the other thigh now, another kiss. Higher up her thigh now.

His head coming forward now though, he moved forward between her thigh with a direct purpose.

A moment of anger as she had commanded him to go slower this evening...bitten back by an immediate whimper escaping her lips as he bit down on the edge of her panties, peeling them away from her wet, pulsing lips...

Slidding her panties down her thighs then, down her calves and off her legs. Looking down at him, she sees him lift her panties to his mouth, his tongue darting to taste the nectar she left for him, thinking of this moment on the ride home. Her flavour causing him to moan deeply.

Kimberlee closed her eyes and felt pleasure, awareness of how deeply this man worshipped her and would do anything to please her. Tonight, she was undoubtedly a goddess.

Setting down her panties, he moved forward, gripping hard on her thighs he moved his face forward. Even commanded to go slowly, he was only a man who ached for her taste.

Leaning in and kissing the mound of her pubic area. Working his way down along the side of her lips, Kisses, licks and nibbles.

She could feel herself dripping now, thinking she may have been wetter than she ever has before.

Almost on queue, his tongue dips out and licks, pressing his tongue wide against her lips, dragging with pressure from the bottom to the top of her folds. He pauses then and moans deeply in his throat, savouring the way her juices tastes to him.

Diving back between her thighs, he was losing control now. He sucked deeply on her clit. Needing to make her lose herself just the way he was falling deeper into the ache and need to be a source for her pleasure.

Needing to hear her whimper he sucked hard and deeply taking her clit between his lips, rubbing her swollen bud with the flat of his tongue, rolling it side to side.

She could feel his tongue moving and digging into her as the pressure from him sucking fell away.

"Fuuuuuck...." she moaned aloud.

Pausing for the briefest of moments, taking his mouth from her, Liam looks up and moans into her flesh "My goddess" before biting into her thigh. He was her good boy tonight, but she would see the mark and remember the pleasure he gave her for a couple days. Leaving his mark on her.

Bringing his fingers up, sliding into her easily now that she was so wet, curling up and rubbing her mound inside her pussy, rubbing her clit with the thumb of his hand, kissing along her thigh after the bite. Moving his way up to combine his mouth with his fingers. She needed to be worshipped, but he needed to hear her cry out.

Kissing along her lips, coming up to cup his lips around her clit again, his finger curling, with a perfectly timed wave, the pressure on her clit growing, feeling the warmth build in her centre, slowly building and growing.

Reaching forward she grabbed for his hair, needing to grab, to pull anything to bring him into the blackness that was about to crash over her.

The pulsing and waves crashing over her body....and then there was nothing. Everything and nothing all at once crashing over her, exploding out from her centre.

After what seemed like forever, Kimberlee opened her eyes. That glazed, glassy look.

"Good boy. Now, tea." as she lifted her foot, placing her toes on his chest and pushing him away from her.

She could not hold back that evil smile seeing the bulge in his pants as he got up to make her drink. Maybe she would help him with that. Maybe she would watch as she made him use her panties to stroke himself.

It was good, being his goddess. She Smiled as she leaned back, closing her eyes.

2024-09-17 12:24:04: shouldPasteResources: Pasted text: Oren, sitting on his favourite leather chair slowly took a sip of his favourite scotch from the crystal glass in his hand. The way he looked at you...he wasn't seeing through you or past you like you were some object. It was more like he saw all of you, even when you knew you had his complete attention and every word you said to him mattered; you just knew in the back of his mind he saw you not just as you were in that moment, but he saw you moaning, writhing, gasping and whimpering the way he liked to see you.

These were the thoughts going through Ryonnah's mind as she stretched herself out on the deep red chaise in Oren's office. She took a sip of the wine he had offered her.

"You think she's ready?" she asked him.

Oren sat quiet for a heartbeat or two...."She will be nervous; But I have control of her. I know how to guide her through nerves to being obedient." the smirk on his face belied his own eagerness to test Ayden today. She had done quite well in her progression after their first visit to Ethedo Society's dungeon. "By the end, she'll enjoy herself. Even if she's scared at first."

Just then you could hear the sound of keys jingle as someone unlocked the front door of the home and stepped into the entryway. You could hear her walk into the house, setting down her things near the table in the hallway. She stepped into the living room and saw the door to his office was open and the light on.

"Permission to enter sir?" Not a question as if she was expecting to be answered, but one where she knew it was protocol and a key she needed before she was allowed in the room. She knew that if he did not answer, she would stand and await his response for as long as necessary. From where Ayden stood she could see Oren sitting in his chair, the glass in his hand. His eyes were looking at something else along the wall where the door was...she couldn't see what drew his attention though.

"Two steps in Ayden, then you can stand and wait." Oren spoke. He no longer needed to use the command in his voice. Everything he said to her she knew was not a suggestion or optional. Calm and clear, with the confidence to know your words will be followed to the letter.

The moment he finished speaking she stepped into the room and she saw the body laying stretched out on the chaise and her entire body flushed. She obeyed her protocols when they went to the dungeon and when it was just the two of them, she expected it these times, but not with company in his home yet. She knew she'd do as she was told, that she had to; but there is always another layer of vulnerability when you have to obey with others present. You can't hide who and what you are then.

She knew not to pay close attention to whoever was sitting there. Her eyes on the floor. But she could not help see this woman was still in the edge of her vision and she could see all of her. She almost blended in to the chaise. Everything about her felt sensual. Golden brown hair with the lightest streaks of silver just passed her shoulders, her eyes were green and she looked lightly tanned all over. Not intentionally tanned, but the way you look when you spend plenty of time outdoors enjoying life. She was wearing a deep red dress, almost the exact shade of the chaise. Soft and velvet looking, the straps over her shoulders, form fitting all the way down to end just below her bum. She was not hiding much with that dress. Her legs were crossed as she laid back, the glass of wine in her hand. This woman knew what she wanted. You could just tell, and in that moment, her eyes were fixated on Ayden....she wasn't supposed to pay attention to her, but how could she not?

She knew she was supposed to disrobe the moment she set foot in his office. It was his place of work and her submissive safe place. More than anywhere else in the world, her she was free to give up all control. But looking at the ground her mind raced as she devoured every inch of the stranger on the chaise.

Oren set down his glass. Reached in the end table next to him and pulled out a black leather collar with a steal loop on the end. Walking in front of Ayden, he cupped his hand under her chin and brought her mouth up to his. Pausing, instead of a kiss he moves his mouth close to her ear to whisper to her. "This is Ryonnah. She's here to have fun today and I intend to entertain her, with you." He brings the collar up and places it around her neck, locking the clasp in place. Quickly grabbing a handful of Ayden's hair, he growls "and you know you're not allowed clothing in this room!"

Knowing the mistake she made, she immediately started to strip down. This wasn't a striptease, her purpose here today was to be a toy for Oren and Ryonnah's pleasure. In seconds, she was standing there naked, nervous, excited.

Oren pulled from his pocket a coiled up deep brown and wine coloured leash, clipping it to the loop on Ayden's collar. He took the couple steps over towards the chaise and instead of being able to wait for a command, the short leash pulled Ayden so that she stumbled for a moment and needed to follow along close to him. She looked every bit the pet in that moment.

Looping the end of the leash around the ornate wooden carving at the high point of the chaise, Oren looked directly into Ayden's eyes. "Kneel." There it was. The commanding tone that made her weak in the legs. She almost fell forward onto her knees, slowing herself only at the last second. She found herself kneeling before this woman she had never met before who was still outstretched and enjoying her glass of wine. Oren walked back, behind the lounger, reached down and took the glass from Ryonnah, setting it to the side. Then, taking each of her hands, he raised them both above her head. She looked up at him and gave a little tug trying to pull her arms free. It was no use, his strong hands gripped harder and she knew the games had begun.

"Ryonnah, spread for my little fire."

The evil smile betraying any feigned hesitation at what was to come, as Ryonnah uncrossed her thighs and spread, lifting her leg of Ayden's bowed head.

"The first lesson you were ever taught, was to properly worship and not just suck a cock." he said.

The memory of that first night flashing in her mind. It was not just enough to move your mouth up and down a cock, you needed to kiss and lick and learn every vein and inch of skin and pay attention to the way the person's breathing changed when you touched different spots.

"Now, we teach you to also worship a cunt."

Her eagerness now quite obvious, Ryonnah slid her hips forward just slightly, bringing her pussy less than a foot from the bowed girls face.

"Eyes up little fire." from Oren.

Ayden lifted her head up slowly. She had never been with another woman. Of course she's thought about it before, but never did she think it would happen like this. Right in front of her now, inches away was this woman's pussy. As her hips slide forward, her labia parting lightly. She was already wet...not only was this the first woman she would be with, but her body was already craving her touch. In this moment, Ayden knew without any doubt, being the source of pleasure for others around her was an aphrodisiac that would always make her melt.

"I have her hands held tight, so you are going to listen to my every command and you are going to be the toy we use for pleasure tonight."

"Hands on both of her knees...just like that. Now spread her thighs just a little wider.."

Ryonnah's labia spreading, opening her even more. Her clit now starting to show. The wetness glistening. It drove her wild when she knew eyes were on her. Inspecting her. Before she was even touched, just having Ayden staring at her cunt, knowing she would devouring her soon filled Ryonnah's eyes with fire.

"A kiss on her thigh little fire. Let her know you're here for her pleasure."

Ayden leaned her head to the side and the lightest of kisses. The touch of her lips on Ryonnah's thigh brought out the slightest of whimpers from her. She needed her mouth on her clit now! What was he waiting for!

"Work your way forward now. Not too quickly. I want her feeling each little kiss like a shock inching it's way closer to it's goal." As Ayden kissed her again and again...twice, three times. Her head was only inches from her pussy now.

"Hold!" Oren commanded.

"Now slowly, keeping your face nice and close, move across her lips, no touching now...she can feel your breathe on her. But we need to make her other leg feel the pleasure too. Move your way out and give her a kiss. All over again, work your way up her thigh." he unconsciously bit down on his own lip when he heard the angry tone to the whimper that escaped from Ryonnah knowing how desperately she wanted what was coming.

As Ayden's mouth worked it's way up Ryonnah's thigh, again she was only inches from her wet lips, flush with blood now.

Ryonnah gave a more honest pull with her arms and Oren's grip hardened. She was not going to get her arms free she knew. Whatever he had planned was happening.

Ayden was frozen. Her mouth only an inch, maybe two from the pussy in front of her. Ryonnah could feel each exhale.

Oren pulled the leash off the wooden decoration, lifting Ayden's head up "I think she deserves a kiss now don't you? Just above the clit. Show her your appreciation for getting to please her."

Ayden leaned in, the leash still tight, and she lightly kissed the pubic mound just above Ryonnah's now aching clit.

"Does she look wet enough for a taste yet little fire?" Oren asked

Ayden could see her actually dripping. Her juices starting to run down her lips and taint "...dripping wet sir..."

"Obey to the letter Ayden. Give Ryonnah a little lick, just below the start of her lips, the tip of your tongue parting her. But you'll stop half way. Just a taste.."

Ayden inhaled...Ryonnah's scent. The wetness. God she was getting soaked herself just being used like this...and she leaned forward. Her tongue darting out.

The moment it touched Ryonnah's skin her breathing stopped and she felt the tongue of this girl part her lips. Felt her tongue curl up and lap up her juices. and then it was gone. She knew what he said, to stop halfway up. But holy fuck she needed her clit licked so badly now. Her eyes shot lightning up at Oren "Don't you fucking dare stop her again!" She barked at him.

Oren smirked at her. Moving her hands closer together, he gripped them both with one hand and squeezed tight. His free hand reaching down to lift Ryonnah's chin up. He leaned down and gave her a deep kiss. "You'll get what you have coming...when I say you're ready for it." Quickly putting both hands back on hers, knowing that jab would make her fight to pull free. And she did. He loved the way she fought back with him. But she knew she was not getting her hands free yet.

"Did you enjoy tasting her little fire?"

The way Ryonnah reacted to that first lick after the teasing...She looked up at the woman infront of her and into her eyes. They weren't just green. There was silver in there too. They almost glowed..she had seen that before. The moon. The nights the moon was so bright, little flecks of colour in the grey and silver. Ayden blushed "I did sir. A lot."

"Another kiss then. Show her you really enjoy pleasuring her. Start at the bottom like you did before, get your tongue inside her and bring yourself up. Finish with a little kiss on her clit."

Ayden followed her orders to the letter and Ryonnah's eyes closed as she felt this young slut's tongue part her lips. She even paused for a brief second to make she sure swallowed some of her juices. This girl was truly going to devour her if she could. Working her way up, curling her tongue. Swallowing and then leaning in to kiss Ryonnah's clit.

Before she had even pulled her lips back from kissing her, Oren came with more directions. She heard him and knew she would obey, but they were really only a voice in the back of her mind. Her whole world was between this woman's thighs. Her taste. Her smell.

"Your whole tongue now. Lap her up. Lick from top to bottom. Don't miss an inch. like a good little bitch I want you licking her." as Ayden's head began to slowly bob up and down and she followed her orders.

"Now pull your head back. Take your mouth off her and we're going to bring your hand into this. Trace along her lips with the pad of your thumb, up and around the clit. Using her wetness and your saliva. Teasing around her clit in a circle."

Ryonnah was almost purring now as she let herself fall for this little slut between her thighs and the man commanding her above him who's own bulge in his pants began to grow at the sights before him.

"Now get your index and ring finger nice and wet. Suck on them first, then tease them along her lips."

"Sir I am dripping wet..."

"You're our toy today Ayden. If you behave, we might let Ryonnah use her strap-on on you later." at that Ayden's eyes went wide. She had told Oren one of her favourite fantasy's was being shared by a couple.

"Now slide your fingers inside little fire. Stretch her ever so slightly and feel for her g-spot."

"Just like this.." and grabbing both of Ryonnah's hands with his one hand, he motioned his free hand like he was calling her to him.

Ryonnah's hips instinctively pressing down, trying to increase the pressure with the motion he knew Ayden was now making inside her.

"Good Girl, Little Fire."

"Now, keep teasing her inside, I want you to start with your mouth again. Tease around her clit. Trace with your tongue. Work your way in to the centre again and suck on her clit."

Ryonnah was almost losing control. Her arms were pulling from Oren without conscious thought. He was guiding this little slut to drive her wild and the way she obeyed, following orders without hesitation made every lick and suck and tease of her fingers feel like someone more experienced than she knew she was. She was getting so close. She needed more pressure. More aggression.

I think Ryonnah's getting close Little Fire."

"I want you to pull your mouth away, but keep your fingers teasing her inside." and she did...

But that was too much teasing. Ryonnah NEEDED this to continue.

And Oren knew it from watching her.

Ryonnah pulled her arms trying to get free...and this time, he did not hold her back. Her arms free she reached down and grabbed a handful of Ayden's hair, forcing her mouth back onto her clit.

"Lick and suck and don't fucking stop you fucking slut!" she growled at this girl between her thighs. Her legs squeezed to trap her head in place. She pulled her in to her cunt to increase the pressure she felt on her clit....the fingers inside her.....grinding her face into her wetness...and the world exploded around her...

Ryonnah screamed and shook and convulsed. Squirting, she covered this young sluts face with her juices. And Ryonnah collapsed on the chaise. Wetness everywhere. and Ayden kneeling there....licking her lips, her fingers. With a look on her face like a cat that just caught her prey.

But Oren knew that Ryonnah would not be done with Ayden tonight. This woman had an appetite to match his own. His little fire's test had only just begun and the night was young.

2024-09-17 12:24:42: shouldPasteResources: Pasted text: I was just finishing setting things up around the house when I heard Ayden's car pulling up. Having spent the afternoon at the society, I knew there was a conversation that needed to happen with her. Things were about to become...more for us. If it was something she wanted.

At that thought I smiled. Of course she would. Insatiable slut, I thought to himself. She loves to hate that word Insatiable.

At that thought I heard the door open. Placing the pillow I had in my hands down on the chaise and started toward the entryway. This would be an important night for her and us.

As I came around the corner, I saw here there, Aydens waiting, kneeling. Her knees spread open and her hands on her thighs, palms up. Just as she had always been instructed to enter my home, awaiting my permission to enter further.

Walking up to her, I offered my hand for her to stand up. Of course she stood without assistance, as was her way of things. There was nothing I could not make her do, but still I would offer to help her again and again when the opportunity arose. She always needed to know that I would always be there for her.

"Come my little fyre, we have to talk about something tonight." I said, turning to head toward the living room confident she would be only steps behind me. As we got into the living room I headed for and sat down on the chaise.

Ayden asked "Drink sir?"

"A glass of wine, the scotch can wait for another night." I replied.

After Ayden poured him a glass of my favourite Malbec and brought it to me, ensuring her Dominant received his drink before she went back and poured herself a glass of Pinot Grigio. She turned to face me and I placed my hand on the chaise beside me. She walked up and took the seat next to me, the curve and headrest of the chaise to her left.

She was used to me being more aggressive with what I wanted from her. I could see she was a little off because of how I seemed kinder tonight.

"You remember Shea? You met them the other night." I asked.

"I do" the slightest of flushing came to her cheeks as she remembered being in control that night. The plug. The dildo.

"Something you may not know about Shea, is that although they have an owner at the society, it might be more accurate to say that The Society as a whole, owns them. Shea is a non-binary person who has...given their life to the society. Whoever runs the whole place, owns Shea, and has their obedience." Oren clarified.

Ayden nodded, trying to fully grasp the idea that a person would give themselves up to the whole group.

"I spent the afternoon at the society house. You know the place, we've been there a couple times now. I believe the last time we put on the delightful show for the crowd when I had you moaning like a whore infront of everyone." I continued.

I loved taking those little jabs at her. Reminding her how delicious I find it when she gives in to the moment and lets herself react to every bit of stimulus without reservation. She means the world to me. I do believe she knows when I tease and poke at her, it was only to counter, thinly veiled at best, the depth of my feelings for her.

Ayden nodded, her skin still lightly kissed by the warm flushing of blood under her skin.

"Things are changing there. Liam is not at the centre of it, but his owner is. Sara. She's stepping down from her position at the head of the society...and Liam mentioned I should be put forth as a new potential head of the entire organization." I told her.

Ayden's eyes went wide.

"YOU'D BE PERFECT FOR THAT!" she squealed. She was never very good at hiding her excitement about something she truly felt.

I stood up at that. Wanting her looking up at me to try and reign in her excitement just a bit. There was more to be discussed first.

"Thank you for believing that Ayden. But there's a lot more to it than that. Shea for one. They belong to whoever runs the Society. So Shea, would become mine for one." I stated

Ayden's skin flushed a shade darker red "Shea was so much fun!" she blurted, barely containing her excitement. Me standing up was not lost on her and I could tell she was struggling to contain her excitement at the idea.

"There's more to it though. You, for example." I said sternly.

At that Ayden's face went blank. I couldn't read her or exactly what she was thinking, but I could tell a million and one thoughts were firing through her mind that moment.

"If I am going to take a role at the top of this Society group, it would place you there aswell Ayden." I said bluntly.

Ayden's face was still blank. She was thinking still, but I could tell there was a mix of excitement and fear. She was struggling to accept exactly what this meant for her. She would only still belong to me surely, I bet she thought.

I reached down and took her glass of wine from her hand, only a couple sips had been taken by then, setting it on the end table.

When she was like this. Her mind racing and trying to process everything that had been relayed to her, this was the time I absolutely loved to play with her. Her defenses were down and there was no way she could not let herself fall deeply into what was coming.

"I'm going to let you process what I said." I stated.

"But I..." she started, and before she could get out a third word, my hand was on her throat, pressing for silence. Her eyes went wide and pupils dilated.

"What you think right now, does not matter. I have other things I want from you." at that I gave her that evil smirk that both drove her wild and infuriated her. I needed to make it clear to her, from this point on she would not get a word in edge-wise.

I loosened the grip I had on her throat, ever so slightly, just enough to hold her in place, but not enough to ever really call it a choke.

My right hand reaching down, brushing the back of my hand across her stomach as I reach for the belt on her jeans.

My eyes never leaving hers.

My fingers move and the belt comes loose, and my fingers make their way to the button of her jeans and that button opens for me even easier.

The finger of my hand working inside her jeans, and with a force showing the need to have her naked infront of me, I reach down and force her jeans to her ankles. I know that move would have left her with friction burns on her thighs, but I also know she loves it when I force her like that.

Standing up, my hand immediately goes for the hem of her shirt and lifts up. Her hands go up instinctively and I pull her shirt up over her head. It leaves her hair a bit of a mess, but she knows better than to adjust yet. She knew better than to be wearing a bra coming over here, and her nipples were already very hard with excitement.

I turned my back to her and walked to get my glass of wine. over my shoulder I exclaimed. "Now finish what I started, and make yourself naked for me."

As I grab my wine and turn back to visually inspect my little slut, I take a sip and watch her peel her panties down and kick them and her pants to the side.

She stood there for a moment. Completely naked for me and I appreciated it, taking my time, sipping my wine while she could only stand there and be looked upon in this state.

"Let's see just how much you enjoy me playing with you." as I set my glass down, walking closer to her.

I leaned in close to her ear "Spread." I command. and her legs part, only a couple inches, but enough for me to properly inspect her.

Running my hand from her shoulder, down her arm, teasing the back of her hand, the sensation shooting from her hand up her arm and straight to her chest. I can see her breathe deeply. I love to trace along her body, taking a different path every time. Making sure she feels me all along her entire body.

Moving my hand from the back of her hand, across to her thigh and tracing along to her inner thigh and reaching up, parting her lips with my fingers. Tracing along the innner parts of her pussy.

"You're getting wet already, just from me forcing you to be like this. Just from me inspecting you like this." I said to her flatly. Almost an accusation. I know she loves having eyes on her, every inch of her.

"Kneel for me Ayden." I command and she drops to her knees.

My hands going to the fly on my jeans. Unzipping them and pulling out my cock. It had only started to fill with blood, she wasn't the only one getting excited. "Suck your Dom hard slut." I command.

I could tell she had not fallen completely under the spell of the moment and so many thoughts about what we had talked about before were running through her mind as she opened her mouth, but then stuttered "Sir..about what.." and I slapped her. Not nearly as hard as I have before, but enough to make her mind go blank for a moment. Grabbing her hair with my left hand I pull her head towards my groin and put my slowly hardening cock in her mouth. "You don't think, you obey. When I want to converse with you, I will tell you. Now suck!" I bark at her.

She lets her training take over and starts to twirl her tongue around the head of my cock. Licking along the frenulum, making sure to tease me with the tip of her tongue.

As my cock starts to quickly come to life inside her mouth I let out a deep moan. "Don't you love when I let you take care of me like this? Your hands had better be pleasing yourself too" as I look down and notice her right hand quickly dart to her pussy to begin rubbing. "It should always turn you on, the thought of my cock in your mouth." I reinforce to her.

As my cock hardens and she begins to slowly work the length of my cock deeper into her mouth, my hips start to thrust ever so slightly and I have to shake my head to not lose control of the moment.

Pulling back quickly I take my cock from her as the long string of her saliva drips from the tip to her lips and she can't help but whimper at her suck toy being taken from her. She doesn't like it when her toy gets taken from her and so she snaps forward with a bite in the air with her teeth.

I growl at her "Bitch!" and grab for her hair, lifting her up to a standing position.

The second I have her standing, my left hand returns to grab at her throat and begins to push her back, backpedaling to the chaise where she falls back, gently guided by my hand on her neck. Her head and neck pressed against the head of the chaise, I reach down with my right hand and grab her left wrist, then letting go of her neck I reach and grab her right wrist with my left hand bringing them both up above her head.

"You have been such a brat lately." I tell her as I move my head on close. Too close apparently as she lunges forward, her wrists in my hands and she moves in for what I think is a passionate kiss, but as our lips touch, she bites down on my lip instantly drawing blood as I pull back from the pain.

A drop of my blood on her lips and she looks up at me, making sure to have my eye contact as she licks the drop from her own lips and smiles at me.

Shifting my hands so that my right hand held her wrists btoh above her head I reach down with my left and raise her right thigh up, exposing her now dripping went pussy.

Ever since I let her play with Shea she's had an incrdible almsot feral streak to her. This kind of play drove her wild.

Leaning in closer, placing my left leg kneeling on the chaise I bring my hard cock closer to her and reaching down with my left hand I line myself up and start to slide in.

As the head of my cock parts her lips and starts to slide inside her, the wetness and warmth of her enveloping my cock I cannot help but moan. I'm sliding in deeper and as I get the base and press fully inside her, her eyes close and she lets herself fully go. Biting her own lip as I move my hips back, almmost all the way out and then slide forward again, only inching myself inside her. No full strokes just yet.

As I keep teasing her with an inch at a time, in and out, I reach down with my now free left hand and begin to rub and tease her clit. The second I I touched her, she moaned.

Removing my hand from her clit I reached under her and lifted her ass up, and shifted my own hips so that she was almost suspended on my thighs.

Not wanting her to fall out of the spell I bring my left hand back to her clit and continue rubbing and teasing, now letting myself fully push my cock inside her. Moaning with each full stroke I can feel her clench down on me.

She begins to breathe more and more shallow as the feeling of her hands restrained above her head and my left hand rubbing her clit while she's being penetrated like this takes her deep into the spell of the moment.

A couple more strokes of my cock and the pace of the rubbing on her clit and I can feel her body begin to tense. She's close and I can tell the way her body moves and the way her breathing changes it won't be long until she's lost to world completely for the moments the waves crash over her and then it happens. Her breathe stops and her entire body clenches tight. Her abs contract, her pussy clenches down on my cock, making sure I don't stop thrusting while she's coming, but only slightly pulling back with each thrust. I want her to have something to clench down on.

After a couple moments, her eyes open and are glassy and much more relaxed after her first orgasm pf the night.

Slowing my thrusting I pull out of her, my cock glistening with her juices.

I stand up and still holding her wrists above her head, I move my hips closer to her head. "Taste your own delicious pussy" I tell her bluntly as she opens her mouths and takes my cock in. Her lips lock down and I feel her tongue twirl around my cock as I pull back and she sucks every drop of herself she can get.

"mmmmm" is all she can say right now still coming back from the first wave.

I let go of her wrists and her arms relax. Reaching down I scoop her up into my arms and carry her to my room. We almost never play in the bedroom though. It's always the livving room or office. This...is different and I wonder if she even realizes.

Once we get into the bedroom I stand her up slowly, making sure her legs are working. and I turn on the light. There she see's herself in the large mirror on the other side of the bed. Her face flushed, her hair a mess. The redness on her wrists from where I was gripping her so hard.

I moved behind her and being to let my hands wander, starting down on her thighs I grip her hard. Moving up and brushing the tips of my fingers along her lips and I feel the shiver go through her body.

Leanign in closer I begin to speak in her ear "If I am going to take over the Society Ayden, it will be with you at my side. Submissive to me, always" At that I look at her face in the mirror and give her a smirk and she blushes.

"But you would need to become more, to everyone else, just like I would. Shea would not belong to just me, but to you as well. It would raise you above all others too."

Her eyes went down as I could see her struggling to comprehend the depth of what I was saying while she was still only marginally grasping everything around her.

I pushed her forward onto the bed then on her stomach. and Reached down, grabbing her thighs with strong hands I slide her further on to the bed. Crawling up on top of her. My legs on either side of hers, pinning her down.

Leaning forward I continue to speak in to her ear.

"I know tonight is not just any night Ayden. I know it's your Birthday.." as I smirk at her look in the mirror. We're never supposed to talk about this day. I know it bugs her. "and so I want to be perfectly clear on this night when I tell you, if I don't have you at my side, I won't be taking this role with the Society. For you, I would burn this entire world down. It would mean nothing to me. With you, I will take it all over. Rule it all. That is what you mean to me and what I want you to think about....when I'm finished with you and your mind tonight."

With that I leaned back on my legs and reached down, a quick stroke or two to make my cock harder and I start to tease it between her thighs.

All the while she's staring at me in the mirror. Her eyes are watering, she's on the edge I know.

I gently slap her ass and her hips raise up. Rubbing my cock along her lips I see her pc muscles tense up and clench, gently rubbing the tip of my cock along her lips I wait for her to relax before I press forward.

I can see her let go and open herself up and so I lean forward and begin to press my cock inside her. Feeling the wetness and warmth inside her.

Not finished with my head games tonight, I give her that evil smile. As I lean forward and just the bulbous head of my cock inside her wet pussy. I tell her "Now make yourself a useful slut and take my cock."

"I'm more than..." she snaps back at me and I thrust forward filling her and she moans before she can finish the sentence.

"You have always been more than that Ayden." I tell her as I continue to thrust back and forth inside her, pinning her down. My left hand pinning her shoulder into the bed, my right hand gripping her ass with allthe strength I have as I thrust inside her over and over. This one is for me and I will take this from her.

The sounds of my hips smakcking against her ass as I fuck her with every stroke. I look up in the mirror and see her lift her head and her eyes roll back in her head. She is completley lost to the moment. My pace is quickening fatser and faster as I lose control. I'm getting closer and closer and then like a jolt of lightning it fires through my body and I push as deep inside her as I can. As my body shudders I hear her moan "Fuuuuuccckkk" and she grips the bedsheets with both hands.

We both collapse on the bed, me on top of her, breathing deeply.

A while later I roll over and she looks up at me..."More, Sir."

I smile...."Insatiable."

This was going to be a long night and a memorable birthday for Ayden.

2024-09-17 12:25:30: shouldPasteResources: Pasted text: She always got so excited before their playdates, but something felt...different today.

From the moment she woke up, things just seem to be going her way. A hair day that would make any kick-ass Valkyrie jealous, the sunlight through her window gave her a golden glow, and if she didn't know any better, it looked like all the plants in her ... bowed to her?

It must just be a trick of the light. She thought as she shrugged it off and headed out the door in her favourite leather jacket. She just knew today was..her day.

She pulled up to Oren's place and started to get those familiar feelings in her tummy. Excitement. Fear. Arousal. Fuck... every time she came here it just hit her liker a wave.

Walking in she saw Oren sitting on his favourite leather chair across the room. She paused. She knew the protocols and went to her knees. Not a word, just waiting.

"Ayden, come here. We have time for those other games another day. I want to introduce you to someone."

He had someone else here before once. His friend Ryonnah....and she was...she had the same control over her he did. She was so powerful. That night Ayden learned there was another path she wanted to explore in life....eventually. To be in control of the other end of the leash.

This wasn't the first time another person was here, and she knew she could completely trust Oren, so this didn't phase her at all and she arose, walking toward the living room.

"Ayden, I want you to meet Liam, he's a friend of mine from the club, and we're going to play a game with you tonight." Oren spoke calmly.

"Happy to sir." Ayden replied. But there was something about his voice. It wasn't so..commanding today. Where is this going? She thought to herself.







Liam stood up. He was probably a good half a foot taller than Ayden. His dirty blonde hair was different from Oren's deep brown hair. He was clean shaved too. You could tell he wasn't young by the lines on his face, but shaved like he was he seemed....more innocent?

He had broad shoulders and looked like someone that could handle themselves if a fight broke out. Not her normal type, but there was something almost...playful about Liam. This could be a fun night she thought to herself.

"I'm happy to meet you Ayden. Oren's been telling me all about you....." He looked about a little nervously. He was different than Oren. How he carried himself. "Can I go get you a drink?" He asked abruptly.

.."Sure. Uh...wine. Red. Oren keeps it in the liquor cabinet.." She said pointing to the carved wooden bar on the other side of the living room. This was..different. Normally she would be the one fetching the drinks for Oren and his guests.

As Liam walked toward the cabinet, Ayden couldn't help but admire his ass. You don't see that kind of curve on most guys, but damn...Liam took care of himself.

She turned to look at Oren who had that kind of smirk on his face she only ever saw after she was finished with a scene. When she was shaking after the orgasms and trying to catch her breathe. Evil. Satiated. Entertained. Ayden looked to him for a command, guidannce on how the night would progress.

Oren shrugged then. "Liam and I met at the club. But he's not so...demanding as me. He prefers to be told what to do.." he said gesturing to Liam getting the drinks.

He wasn't quiet about it either. There was no way Liam could not hear what he was saying. Ayden saw him pause for a second while pouring her wine, but then continue like nothing had happened.

She looked back at Liam, then to Oren...and her eyes went wide. She never got to be in this position before. Her and Oren had talked it once or twice. But only just talked.

How did...

How did he know...

Fucking Oren and the way he read her.







After they had sipped some wine and spent time learning about each other, they had made their way to Orens office which doubled as the playroom.

Already on the desk were the Doxy. Orens Womanizer vibe and the new set of plugs Oren had bought. They weren't anal plugs though. These were shaped different. The size of them.

Aydens eyes widened when she realized they were vag plugs.

Oren leaned over to Ayden and whispered in her ear "He's at your command. Enjoy yourself. Seek your own pleasure, we'll work on domming for pleasure of the sub later. Tonight, your command, is his wish and pleasure."

Then he walked straight to his desk chair, sat and continued sipping his scotch. Quiet. No doubt the ass was enjoying the show, she thought to herself.

She was in control though. Tonight was going to be for her. She knew today felt different....and that same evil smirk came on her face. Not for the last time.

The first thing she wanted to do was test just how much control she might have here.

Turning, she walked over to Liam. His head was down, but he still stood over her.

"Kneel." Ayden said, trying to do her best Oren impression. But Liam hesitated.

She paused, and could hear Oren shift in his chair behind her.

She reached up, grabbing Liam's throat this time.

"I said...On. Your. Knees." and Liam dropped down. So suddenly she thought it almost caught her off guard. But not quite.

"Good boy." She said patting him on the head. "Now kiss my foot for making me tell you twice." WOW that came super easily to her. She might have a knack for this she didn't know was there. To her pleasure, he leaned forward, his head making it's way to the ground and she felt the heat of his breathe through he stockings and the pressure of him kissing the top of her foot.

"So you like to be told what to do?" Ayden asked him Liam. She had asked him this before too, but she was stalling for a little time as she thought about how she wanted this to go.

"If I feel safe...yeah...It makes me feel useful...." Liam muttered.

Something about that word useful triggered something in her mind...let's run with it she thought.

She grabbed the Doxy vibe and decided to use it like a sceptre. Putting the head under his chin lifting his gaze up.

"I'm looking forward to seeing just how useful you can be tonight. Crawl forward and help me get out of these jeans." She commanded and Liam did as he was told. Crawling forward, then reaching up. Unbuttoning the front. Unzipping the fly, and pulling down. and reaching up to pull down her tight jeans. A second set of hands always made this easier.

As her jeans came off, one leg, she stepped out of and then the other. "Throw them to the side for me." Ayden said.

There he was, on his knees, knowing if he stood he would easily tower over this girl. Even if he sat upright his eyes would be close to her breasts, but head bowed forward he was right in line with her belly button. The pink panties she was wearing directly infront of his eyes and he could feel that tingle in his groin. The blood begin to flow. The excitement of being at her command only sent him deeper into this place. This need to obey.

Ayden, looking down at this man under her spell, she could feel herself becoming excited. Even with the short time she's had in this role, the power she had over him was intoxicating. She could already feel herself begin to get wet, her heart beating and her blood pumping through her body. And yet...she never felt more relaxed in all her life. Being on this end of the leash, and she felt...free.

She needed more.

"I need to feel, full boy." Ayden stated. not a command, yet.

The slightest of reactions from Liam as his eyes widened ever so slightly. He could already feel it, the blood flowing to his cock. Being commanded by her felt amazing.

Ayden looking over at the desk got an idea, and she smiled. Joy at first, then evil the way her eyes narrwed.

"open your mouth Liam." She said. As she slipped her panties down to her ankles. Exposed, naked from the waist down. She reached down and grabbed her panties from the ground, scrunched them up and leaned forward, placing them into his mouth. She placed her hand under his jaw and closed his mouth. "Keep those safe for me for now."

As she turned to walk toward the desk, she shot Oren that same evil smile. He had made a monster, or unleashed one. But she could tell by the bulge in his pants he was enjoying the show. She thoguht to herself, I wonder if I could have Liam take care of that bulge for me. She shrugged, and stepped to the desk. She, would be taken care of first.

Over her shoulder, she commanded to Liam. The voice coming easily to her now. "Lay on the ground, on your back boy. We'll see how useful you are." and she could hear him obey immediately.

She grabbed the plug and the the Womanizer. Turning back to see Liam laying there on his back. The bulge in his pants very obvious. He was so turned on by this. A shame he wouldn't taken care of tonight though. The thought really didn't bother her though. Tonight was hers.

Walking over to Liam, she knelt down, removing the panties from his mouth. "Time to be a useful boy Liam" she said gently tapping his cheek.

As she lifted her leg, straddling his face. Her pussy directly above his mouth, her back to Oren and this man laying on the ground infront of her.

"Lick" She commanded, as she lowered herself down. Feeling his tongue and mouth come in contact with her. His tongue starting by trying to taste all of her. Wide strokes across her whole pussy. His mouth and lips trying to suck in all of her. God this man was trying to devour her like she was his last meal.

She really had him worked up...

Leaning forward to position her clit better for his tongue, she teased the bulge in his pants and she felt him moan.

In his mind, this goddess was preparing herself, ready to ride him. Use him and his cock for her pleasure. This was everything he ever wanted...

In her mind, the moans, knowing how turned on he was by her, she was enjoying teasing him. She was going to have plenty of fun tonight.

His mouth and tongue continuing to work her lips and clit. Grinding herself down onto his mouth.

After a couple minutes, she thought she was plenty wet enough for the next part of her plan. She lifted off him, kneeling beside his head. She reached down and grabbed the plug.

"Open back up Liam. Open wide." She said.

He did as ordered and she placed the end of the plug in his mouth. It rising up above his face now.

But the look in his eyes was different. Not fear, but close to it. He knew the plug would go in her. He could only hope his cock would follow. If only he obeyed more, she would grant him this.....

Ayden Lifted herself up, back over Liams head. And she started to lower herself down onto the plug. She reached down, squeezing the plug to be smaller so it would slide in. She was very wet, but this was no small plug. As she pressed her hips down, she could feel it slide inside her and it expanded filling her. Stretching her and she moaned "Liaaauuuuuhhhhhhh....Fuck" as it fully stretched her inside.

She took a moment to collect herself and she commanded him "Let go of the base Liam. You're done this part. Now you enjoy a show." As she raise her hips up, she turned on the womanizer. So full and stretched. So wet and aroused. This man laying on the ground underneath her. His cock hard. Not just a bulge anymore. All from pleasing her.

She had never felt more powerful than she did in that moment.

And she brought the vibe to her clit and she started to loudly moan. Full and stretched. The womanizer pulsing on her clit now. She was in a state of ecstacy.

She had this man completely at her command. Shifting her body forward she growled. The animal inside her taking control. "My ass Liam. Make yourself useful. Lick me." and his tongue darted out, liking her ass as it sent a shiver and convulsing through her body. Reaching forward, she groped his hard cock through his pants and he moaned into her again. Shifting back, she reached up, groping her breasts and nipples through her shirt and she felt it building. The waves started to splash against her body. She gasped...and her body tightened and she lost control. Her body shaking as the orgasm rolled over her body. The tongue on her ass, the vibe, the full feeling inside her. The power she felt...

and she fell to the side.

After a few moments she looked over and she had soaked the man who used to be under her. Breathing to herself. She waited until she felt like she could move and she reached over, gently slapping Liam on the cheek again. "Good boy. I'm going to keep the plug inside me for now. I like the full feeling. Maybe later we'll play with that cock of yours.

Later that evening after the encounter with Henley in the woods I was sitting on the couch at home.

Shadow just doesn't move that like. I was seeing things. That has to be it, I kept telling myself.

I just couldn't shake that....hands everywhere vibe I got when the shadow seemed to grow around me. Crawl...up my body. I shivered then.

I need to warm up. I muttered out loud.

Grabbing my bottle of wine I went and turned on the faucet for a good hot bath and grabbed the bluetooth speaker I brought on the trip. A little heat, some wine and I'm just gonna let the music melt today away. I just need to relax...and I can get on with closing that tree farm and back to my life.

As I sank into the tub, feeling that heat and warmth envelope my body I almost completely forgot about the shadows. Almost.

Even when you're completely relaxed and feel like there's nothing else in the world, that one little bit of nibbling information can just refuse to let go. The fucking shadow moved. I know it.

No!. I said to myself as I laid back and let the rest of my body sink into the heat around me. It was nice when the darkness and shadow grew. It wasn't cold like you would think. It was...nothing. Almost like the time I went in that float tub. No coldness, just like a warm glove wrapping itself around my body.

As I closed my eyes I swear I saw the candle flicker. There was no wind in the bathroom. No reason for it to do that, but for the briefest of moments, the darkness almost blacked out the light of the candle. It was nothing. Just a trick of my eyes in the dark room.

Letting myself go, I closed my eyes and started to enjoy the heat of the liquid around me. I could feel it radiate up my body, moving towards my breasts. Like I was sinking deeper into the water, I know I wasn't...but I just didn't care right then. This felt good.

The warmth travelled up my body, covering me in this warm embrace. I couldn't help myself as I let my hand slip into the warmth of the water and begin to explore my body. Reaching down and slowly sliding up my thigh. I felt the squeeze I love so much...I don't think I squeezed....but it had to be me. There was nobody else in the room with me. It felt so good though...

There it was again...that squeeze. But it was more than a hand...it was my whole thigh and my eyes opened. For the briefest of moments I swear the candle was out, but then it flickered to life. How is that even possible? Was it possible? Do I even care right now?....

Closing my eyes again. I know there was nobody else here. Stop thinking about that fucking shadow.

My hand starts to rub along my body again. It feels like more than just my hand, but I don't care! There is nobody else here and I know it and fuck this feels good.

A moan escapes my lips as I feel myself falling deeper into warmth all around me. I know it's just my mind playing with me and I know I'm alone here. But I do not dare open my eyes. It feels like a blanket of hands caressing me, pulling me into the warmth that surrounds my body. I don't even hear the music playing anymore....just nothingness beyond the feeling of hands and warmth all over me.

Pressure all over. A warm embrace pulling me in, trapping me in this moment. It feels like I can't even move...The briefest of struggle confirms my feeling and I open my eyes.....to darkness. I don't see the candle light anymore. I don't hear the music. I see nothing....

I know I should be terrified by this....but it feels sooo good wrapped in this right now.

What the fuck was in this wine. I know I'm not seeing this, I can't be. I think in denial to myself.

My hands aren't even moving and I feel it all over me now. The water is just black. I can't see anything around me...but I feel it everywhere. Every inch of my body is being touched.

The pressures growing along the inside of my thigh...

Biting my lip as I feel it moving up my leg...the darkness grabbing me...

As Kimberlee was packing up her belongings at her desk, an urge hit her. Grabbing her phone she quickly tapped out the commands.

"You've been a good boy, but today I deserve to be worshipped. You have 20 minutes until I'm home, you'll be waiting infront of the chaise.

Kneeling on your obedience pillow."

"Yes Kimberlee." The required response came from Liam. He knew his role and ached with need every time she allowed him to please her.

Absent mindedly wondering to himself just who received more pleasure from this.

As the keys kingled in her hands, she reached to open the door. Not a moments hesitation knowing what awaited her inside.

As she took off her heels, a feeling almost as good as what she knew was coming. Kicking them to the side she threw her keys in the dish by the door

and her purse on the end table.

Without any more delay she walked into the living room, where Liam awaited on his knees, head bowed.

As she walked toward the chaise, she let her hand run through his dark, chestnut brown hair. As she felt her fingers

flow through his hair, she grabbed roughly to twist his face up to her.

"Never a doubt. Good boy." As she let go of his hair, and began to pour herself into position on the chaise, getting herself comfortable.

Reaching forward, her hand sliding under his chin.

"Begin. And today, I want you to take your time. Worship me."

"Yes Kimberlee."

His hands reached down to the hem of her skirt. It drove her crazy she had to wear the longer skirts to work.

"Stupid rules." she thought to herself. "I make the rules."

One benefit though, was he could take his time raising the skirt up her thighs...Slowly pushing it up, inch by inch. Pausing to kiss her thigh.

Another inch, pausing now, his hands on her thighs and a hard, rough squeeze. He knew she loved his grip. The strength behind it. His need and ache for what was coming.

With that last squeeze of his hand, she could feel the day melting away. All that was or needed to be was this person kneeling before her. Worshipping his goddess.

Leaning forward he began kissing her thigh, just inside and above the knee.

His hands sliding the hem of her dress another inch higher. Moving across to the other thigh now, another kiss. Higher up her thigh now.

His head coming forward now though, he moved forward between her thigh with a direct purpose.

A moment of anger as she had commanded him to go slower this evening...bitten back by an immediate whimper escaping her lips as he bit down on the edge of her panties, peeling them away from her wet, pulsing lips...

Slidding her panties down her thighs then, down her calves and off her legs. Looking down at him, she sees him lift her panties to his mouth, his tongue darting to taste the nectar she left for him, thinking of this moment on the ride home. Her flavour causing him to moan deeply.

Kimberlee closed her eyes and felt pleasure, awareness of how deeply this man worshipped her and would do anything to please her. Tonight, she was undoubtedly a goddess.

Setting down her panties, he moved forward, gripping hard on her thighs he moved his face forward. Even commanded to go slowly, he was only a man who ached for her taste.

Leaning in and kissing the mound of her pubic area. Working his way down along the side of her lips, Kisses, licks and nibbles.

She could feel herself dripping now, thinking she may have been wetter than she ever has before.

Almost on queue, his tongue dips out and licks, pressing his tongue wide against her lips, dragging with pressure from the bottom to the top of her folds. He pauses then and moans deeply in his throat, savouring the way her juices tastes to him.

Diving back between her thighs, he was losing control now. He sucked deeply on her clit. Needing to make her lose herself just the way he was falling deeper into the ache and need to be a source for her pleasure.

Needing to hear her whimper he sucked hard and deeply taking her clit between his lips, rubbing her swollen bud with the flat of his tongue, rolling it side to side.

She could feel his tongue moving and digging into her as the pressure from him sucking fell away.

"Fuuuuuck...." she moaned aloud.

Pausing for the briefest of moments, taking his mouth from her, Liam looks up and moans into her flesh "My goddess" before biting into her thigh. He was her good boy tonight, but she would see the mark and remember the pleasure he gave her for a couple days. Leaving his mark on her.

Bringing his fingers up, sliding into her easily now that she was so wet, curling up and rubbing her mound inside her pussy, rubbing her clit with the thumb of his hand, kissing along her thigh after the bite. Moving his way up to combine his mouth with his fingers. She needed to be worshipped, but he needed to hear her cry out.

Kissing along her lips, coming up to cup his lips around her clit again, his finger curling, with a perfectly timed wave, the pressure on her clit growing, feeling the warmth build in her centre, slowly building and growing.

Reaching forward she grabbed for his hair, needing to grab, to pull anything to bring him into the blackness that was about to crash over her.

The pulsing and waves crashing over her body....and then there was nothing. Everything and nothing all at once crashing over her, exploding out from her centre.

After what seemed like forever, Kimberlee opened her eyes. That glazed, glassy look.

"Good boy. Now, tea." as she lifted her foot, placing her toes on his chest and pushing him away from her.

She could not hold back that evil smile seeing the bulge in his pants as he got up to make her drink. Maybe she would help him with that. Maybe she would watch as she made him use her panties to stroke himself.

It was good, being his goddess. She Smiled as she leaned back, closing her eyes.
